# <a name="Instructions"></a> Instructions
This DSDT and SSDT only works in **Asus Q501LA**. This will **not work** on other laptop.

**How to open EFI parition:**
 1. open your terminal and type in

    `mkdir /Volumes/efi`
    
    `sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/efi`

 2. Then type in your password, there, you got EFI mounted on your laptop, and ready to use.

**Convert *.dsl to *.aml**
 1. Open MaciASL and open DSDT and SSDTs
 2. MaciASL -> File -> Save as -> `save as ACPI Machine Language Binary`
 3. Rename `
	- `dsdt.aml` to `DSDT.aml`
	- `ssdt.aml`, `ssdt1.aml`, `ssdt2.aml`,... to `SSDT.aml`, `SSDT-1.aml`, `SSDT-2.aml`, ...

**Place DSDT and SSDT to Clover**
 1. Place DSDT and SSDT in

    `cd /Volumes/efi/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/`
 
 2. After that, place config.plist in

    `cd /Volumes/efi/EFI/CLOVER/`
    
Before you reboot, you will need to install certain `kexts`, so your laptop can run close to 100%.

# <a name="Kexts"></a> Kexts
There are about 9 kexts that you will need to install. I do not recommend using Multibeast to install your kexts. I would install individual. 

In `kexts` folder, you find:
- ACPIBacklight.kext
- ACPIBatteryManager.kext
- ApplePS2ElanTouchpad.kext
- AsusNBFNKeys.kext
- CodecCommander.kext
- FakeSMC.kext
- GenericUSBXHCI.kext
- RealtekRTL8111.kext
- AppleHDA.kext

I recommend you install both `AppleHDA`, `GenericUSBXHCI`, and `CodecCommander` directly into `/System/Library/Extensions/`. And the rest goes to `/Volumes/efi/EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other/`. Then fix permissions (using kext utility).

Then reboot, you should have close to 100% stable hackintosh.

# <a name="Credit"></a> Credit
I wanted to say thanks to
- MaciASL, Bootloader, InsanelyMac, TonyMac0Sx86
- Rehabman Repo (Rehabman was the one who helped me a lot!).
- conradolpz (for the sleep, changes in BIOs)

Without you guys, I will never get stable hackintosh.

# <a name="FAQs"></a> FAQs
**I got kernel panic bro. What should I do now?**
- It is most likey has to do with your kexts. If you have Voodoo or anything related to Voodoo, just remove that and fix permissions using kext utility. You do not need Voodoo. Boot it in `Safe Mode`

**Why do I have like 9 SSDTs?**
- Each one represents something (According to Rehabman). 
    - SSDT 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 are CPU related.
    - SSDT 3 is Unknown.
    - SSDT 4 is Sata/Hard Drive releated.
    - SSDT 5 is Graphics related.
    - SSDT 6 is Sleep/_WAK related.

**What to do if I found an issue?**
- Login your github account and go to my project and report an issue. Then I will look over your issue.
